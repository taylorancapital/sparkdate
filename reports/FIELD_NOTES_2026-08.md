**August 2026.** Nightly GA4 analysis started running in earnest 2026-08-13,
the Firestore-backed admin dashboard was carrying real live data, and two
Claude sessions collided in a shared checkout on 2026-08-29 — the incident
that is the direct cause of this repository's worktree-per-session rule.
Every incident below was originally catalogued in
`reports/NOTHING_THREW_2026-09-04.md` ("edition 1") as one of its 18; this
edition reproduces them under their original numbers, sorted to the month
they actually happened, as part of a five-month retroactive catch-up written
2026-09-07.

**The one-line finding:** August is the busiest month in this catalogue —
eleven incidents — and the least automated: zero were caught by a
purpose-built check, and only one was caught by anything firing on its own at
all.

| | |
|---|---:|
| Incidents | 11 |
| Caught by anything automated | 1 of 11 (`THREW`, not `GATE`) |
| Caught by a deterministic gate | 0 |
| Concurrency incidents from one shared checkout, one day | 4 |

---

## EVIDENCE — how they were caught

| Detection | Count | |
|---|---:|---|
| `GATE` — a deterministic check refused it | 0 | |
| `THREW` — an actual error surfaced | 1 | |
| `HUMAN` — someone distrusted a number | 4 | |
| `OPERATOR` — reported as "data went missing" | 1 | |
| `LATER` — found by an unrelated dig, days to months on | 5 | |

One of August's 11 (incident 17) was caught by something that fires on its
own — but it is `THREW`, not `GATE`: an operation failing outright, not a
check built to catch it. Of the 18 incidents edition 1 catalogued, exactly one
was ever caught by an actual deterministic gate (incident 13, September), and
it is the only one in the whole original 18. Zero of August's 11 were caught
by a purpose-built check.

## MECHANISM

### A. The agent was confidently wrong — 2 incidents

**03 — A debrief that named the wrong cause.** Published in the Good Good
event debrief, 2026-08-31 (`reports/EVENT_DEBRIEF_GOOD_GOOD_2026-08-31.md`).
An event post-mortem reasoned from the code alone and blamed a two-for-one
ticket offer for a gender imbalance. The flag it depended on was false on
every record involved; the offer had played no part at all — both `+1` seats
that day were men, and both attended.

**Cost:** a confident, circulated, wrong explanation. Rewritten only after
someone queried the data directly — and the superseded reasoning was deleted
rather than kept, because a wrong cause left lying around is worse than none.

**Detection:** `LATER`.

---

**04 — A filtered first query.** Taylor, 2026-08-22, after four rounds of
revised Meta ads conclusions: *"I'm so sick of you being in a constant state
of discovery and doubling back on things that you should have evaluated
fully the first time."* An investigation into an ad account opened by
listing only `ACTIVE` campaigns. Three dormant campaigns — the ones that had
delivered the cheapest clicks the account ever bought — were invisible to
every subsequent step.

**Cost:** three successive proposals, each blocked by a different
constraint, each looking like progress. The real fix was flipping a status
back. The cost was not the wrong answer; it was four review cycles of
someone else's time.

**Detection:** `HUMAN`.

### B. The check passed for a reason unrelated to correctness — 1 incident

**05 — Green locally, red in CI, and the difference was a token.**
2026-08-30. A script called `main()` at module scope instead of guarding on
`require.main === module`. CI, with no API token, hit `process.exit(2)`
synchronously on import and the test process died. The dev machine *had* the
token, so the same import went to the network instead of exiting, and the
synchronous tests finished before the exit landed.

**Cost:** the suite passed for a reason that had nothing to do with the code
being right, and was reported as verified.

> When a check passes, ask what it would have taken to fail. If the answer is
> "different machine state," it verified nothing.

**Detection:** `LATER`.

### C. Silent failure — the error was swallowed and read as absence of data — 4 incidents

**08 — Security rules that were never deployed.** Precedent PR #257,
2026-08-22. Nothing in CI deploys the Firestore ruleset; it is a manual
command. A collection shipped with no matching rule, so the dashboard's read
was denied — and the codebase's deliberate fail-soft handlers swallowed the
permission error into a `console.warn`.

**Cost:** the dashboard reported a materially wrong P&L for as long as the
rules sat undeployed, against a collection holding 73 real documents.
Deploying moved cost $260.00 → $527.38, net revenue $628.44 → $434.68,
blended CAC $12.24 → $15.36.

**Detection:** `LATER`.

---

**09 — A missing composite index inside a live listener.** PR #196,
mid-August. A query combined `where()` with `orderBy()` on a different
field, requiring a composite index that did not exist. Every snapshot threw
"the query requires an index" straight into the listener's own fail-soft
catch.

**Cost:** the widget read "No ticket sales yet" from the moment it shipped.
Reported by the operator as data going missing, not as an error — because in
the UI a permission failure and "nobody has entered anything" are
indistinguishable.

**Detection:** `OPERATOR`.

---

**11 — A finished report with no pull request.** The report finished the
night of 2026-08-31. The automation pushed an analysis branch, then failed
at the step that opens the PR — a multi-line body passed as a command-line
argument, mangled by PowerShell 5.1's own re-quoting into stray arguments.

**Cost:** a completed report stranded for a day, invisible because a branch
with no PR looks like nothing at all. Fixed by writing the body to a file
and passing the path — the same class of fix incident 28 (July) needed for a
different root cause on a different automation stack.

**Detection:** `LATER`.

---

**12 — A data pull that silently overwrote the one before it.**
2026-08-30. Nightly export files are named by table and date, not by pull
time. Two pulls on the same day collide and the second wins — this date has
two sets: a 06:00 UTC pull the GA4 report was built on, and a 12:51 UTC pull
of three new tables. The 06:00 files were kept deliberately.

**Cost:** nearly destroyed the exact dataset a published report cited. The
loss would have been invisible — the report keeps rendering perfectly,
against different numbers.

**Detection:** `HUMAN`.

### E. Concurrency — several agents, one working tree — 4 incidents

*All four of the following happened on a single day, 2026-08-29, from two
Claude sessions sharing one checkout.*

**15 — A pushed commit, overwritten.** Two agent sessions shared one
checkout. One pushed work to a branch; the other reused the same branch name
and force-moved it.

**Cost:** the commit survived unreferenced and had to be recovered from the
reflog. Recovery, not prevention — and only because someone went looking.

**Detection:** `LATER`.

---

**16 — A commit that landed on someone else's branch.** Work intended for
one branch was committed onto another session's, which then committed on top
of it.

**Cost:** untangling took a rebase that dropped a commit from the middle.
One recovery created the next problem.

**Detection:** `HUMAN`.

---

**17 — A branch that could not be created.** `git checkout -b` failed
outright: the shared tree was mid-merge, with a conflict in a file belonging
to nobody in that session.

**Cost:** minutes. Listed because it is the only incident in the original 18
that produced an immediate, honest error.

**Detection:** `THREW`.

---

**18 — A pull request carrying a stale copy of someone else's file.** A
session swept an unrelated in-progress file out of the shared working tree
into its own commit.

**Cost:** caught in review. Had it merged second, it would have silently
reverted a fix already verified against the live API — a regression with a
green diff, introduced by a PR about something else entirely.

**Detection:** `HUMAN`.

## DECISION — what changed in response

The worktree-per-session rule now codified in `CLAUDE.md` ("EVERY SESSION
WORKS IN A WORKTREE") is a direct response to the four concurrency incidents
above, written the day after they happened. Each session now gets an isolated
git worktree branched fresh from the remote main, so no session can inherit
another's half-finished state or reuse its branch name. None of August's
other seven incidents produced a standing countermeasure within the month —
the gate that finally stops a nightly agent from pushing anything itself
(incident 13's fix) and the fact-audit tool that cross-checks public claims
across surfaces (incident 06's fix) both land in September.

## What I did not verify

This is a reproduction, not a re-investigation. Every incident above was
already catalogued, anchored, and classified in edition 1
(`reports/NOTHING_THREW_2026-09-04.md`); this edition changes only which
document each one lives in, sorted by the month it happened. Cost figures,
classifications, and detection modes are unchanged from the original — I did
not re-derive them from primary sources a second time, only re-dated and
re-sorted them using the anchors edition 1 already cited plus, where a
specific day mattered, the underlying commit or PR history.

- **August's 11-of-18 concentration is not a coincidence of dating
  convenience.** It reflects when the systems that produce this catalogue's
  failure modes — a live Firestore dashboard, nightly GA4 automation running
  daily rather than experimentally, concurrent agent sessions on one
  checkout — actually existed at volume. May through July combined produced 6
  incidents across three months; August alone produced 11.
- **Names, account identifiers and customer records are omitted throughout.**
